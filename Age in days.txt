Did you ever want to know how many days old are you? Complete the function which returns your age in days. The birthday is given in the following order: year, month, day.

For example if today is 30 November 2015 then

ageInDays(2015, 11, 1) returns "You are 29 days old"
The birthday is expected to be in the past.


public class Kata {
  public static String ageInDays(int i, int i1, int i2) {
        LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now();
        LocalDate myDate2 = LocalDate.of(i, i1, i2);
        long noOfDaysBetween = ChronoUnit.DAYS.between(myDate2, now);
        System.out.println(noOfDaysBetween);
        return "You are "+ noOfDaysBetween + " days old";
    }
}
